# mql5-strategies
A collection of my (in)complete strategies. Some are finished, some I'm still working on. They are in no way profitable, only for academic purposes.

The `include` directory consists of a few header files I creates to free up space in the main strategy files and to avoid repetition (which every programmer should do).

In order to use this repo, clone it in your `MQL5/Experts/` directory and compile the programs you like. Meta Trader should now be able to load the `.ex5` files to work with.
